# Vue Menu Virtual Scrolling Component

### Explanation
Loading hundreds of elements can be slow in any browser; virtual scrolling enables a performant way to simulate all items being rendered by making the height of the container element the same as the height of total number of elements to be rendered, and then only rendering the items in view.
The menu receives an array prop from the parent component and renders 20 items every time the user scrolls
to the bottom of the menu.
